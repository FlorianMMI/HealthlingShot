                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We created this project during the MMI Night 2026, which took place from January 8 to 9, 2026. It's a 24-hour educational challenge during which we had to work as a team to design a digital project around the theme of exergaming. This event aims to place us in conditions close to the professional world, promoting collaboration, creativity, and project management under time constraints.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The project consists of creating an interactive video game encouraging the player to move their body to progress, as well as a presentation landing page. The goal of this game is to raise awareness of the importance of physical activity and to show that video games can be a fun and positive tool for health, particularly in combating sedentary behavior.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The games had to be developed with p5play, and had to integrate Makey Makey and ML5.js devices to offer innovative physical interactions through body movements and webcam. The landing page, made in English, presents the game concept and imagines possible evolutions for version 2.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The MMI Night concludes with a demonstration before a jury, which evaluates the projects according to their originality, their technical and graphic quality, and their relevance to the theme of exergaming.</p>

            <div class="rules-text">
                <p>The game rules are simple</p>
                <p>The player has 3 lives at the start of the game.<br>
                The objective is to eliminate all unhealthy foods on the screen to advance to the next level.</p>
                <p>To be able to shoot, the player must perform squats:<br>
                1 squat = 1 ammunition.</p>
                <p>For shooting:</p>
                <p>Aiming is done by placing your hand in front of the webcam.<br>
                The shot is triggered using modeling clay connected to the Makey Makey, which allows for physical interaction with the game.</p>
                <p>During the game, elements representing healthy objects and unhealthy objects cross the screen:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the player hits a healthy object, they lose a life.</li>
                    <li>If the player eliminates an unhealthy object, they make progress toward victory.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When all unhealthy elements are eliminated, the player advances to the next level.<br>
                The game ends when the player runs out of lives or successfully wins the final level.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="subsection-title benefits-title">The Benefits</h3>
            <div class="benefits-text">
                <p>This game highlights several benefits, both for the player and in an educational context:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Physically, it encourages bodily activity and helps combat sedentary behavior. By requiring the player to move to play, the game promotes movement, coordination, and can contribute to improving physical condition in a fun way.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Mentally, the game stimulates motivation. Transforming physical effort into a game makes the activity more enjoyable, reduces the feeling of constraint, and can help reduce stress while providing pleasure.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Socially, exergaming can strengthen interaction between players, especially during demonstration phases or collective play. It promotes exchange, cooperation, and sharing around a common experience.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Finally, educationally, this project raises awareness about health and wellness issues while showing that digital technology can have a positive impact. It also highlights technological innovation by offering new ways to interact with a video game through body movement.</p>
